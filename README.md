## Itec 1000
In ITEC 1000, we explored the instructional model of a computer, employing The Little Man Computer to develop a basic application. This program was designed to manage a counter while identifying the largest number within a sequence of numbers using a loop until program termination. Additionally, it facilitated the monitoring and retrieval of variable addresses during execution.

In Itec 1010 I use microsoft access to create a visual database make queries relationship between tables,Input masks,validation rules,
and reports.

Assignment1:
  Part 1: get user input which was use to get the slope & slope intercept of a perpendicualr line. Then I had to find the intercept and th distance.
